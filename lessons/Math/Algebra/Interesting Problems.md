1. [CF-Odd Grasshoper](https://codeforces.com/contest/1607/problem/B)  
> First we need to understand that adding a odd number to x will change the parity while adding an even number will preserve the parity.  

> Now lets look at the first four minutes scenerio, if we start with an even parity number, then after 1 min total displacement will be -1 and the next co-ordinate will have the odd parity, so after 2 minutes total displacement will be 1, but the next co-ordinate will have the same parity, then after 3 mins, total displacment will be 4, and the next co-ordinate will hv the even pairty now, so after 4 minutes total displacement will be 0. And this pattern goes on, on multiple of 4 minutes.  

2. [CF-Minimum Extraction](https://codeforces.com/contest/1607/problem/C)  
> If optimal answer comes after removing m smallest elements, then rather than subtracting every smallest element from rest of the element, we can jst subtract mth element frm the rest elements.
