    <summary>Approach</summary>

    Assume that initally Takahashi does not make any speech in any town, so all the Aoki-Pro voters have voted Aoki. Now greedily choose the city which will make the highest difference after Takahashi makes a speech in that town. Making a speech in a town will create a difference of (2*(Aoki-Pro voters) + Takahashi-Pro voters) voters, so sort the array in accordance to that, and keep making a speech until Takahashi has more number of voters.
