    We can use the Euclid's division lemma, which is writing N = Q*m + R. Now suppose m is a favorite number then Q equals R which we let K then, N = K*(m + 1), from here we can say that (m + 1) is a factor of N. So it is possible when (m + 1) is factor of N therefore just find all the factors of N which is > 1 and return the sum of them.
